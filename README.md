# woffu-autologin-script
This is a small script that auto checks you into your Woffu organization, based on the original https://github.com/d-hervas/woffu-autologin-script

I forked this project from the original to add support for automatic detection of working days. Working days are defined as:

* not in the weekend
* not a requested PTO
* and not a bank holiday

The script won't sign in if today is detected as a non-working day.

The simplest way to use it is to set up a cron job / scheduled task that signs you on/off. The script does not know anything about changes in your working hours (i.e. summer schedule) and you need to address that in your cron job.

# Telegram support

The telegram support relies on these environtment vars: 
* WOFFU_TELEGRAM_APITOKEN
* WOFFU_TELEGRAM_CHATID

The first one is the Telegram ChatBot API Token that you can get from the @BotFather.
And the second one is the ID of the chat you want it to sent the messages.

Once these two vars are set every execution will output its result to this chat, so you can easily track that your signins are running fine (or not).
